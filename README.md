# Delete Lines
I made this script with Pandas in Python in order to automatically process csv's produced by the spectrometer in my chemistry lab. 
It often produced null values in the CSV which made it difficult for my classmates to process the data. They used this script to facilitate cleaning the data
and it improved the work flow in the lab.
